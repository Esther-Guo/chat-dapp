# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a Hardhat use case for users to chat in a decentralized manner. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Open a terminal to start JSON_RPC server and deploy the smart contract:  
```shell
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

```

Open another terminal to start dapp on local machine:  
```shell
npm run dev
```
